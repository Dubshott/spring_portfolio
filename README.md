# Del Norte Class/Teacher Rankings

# 1. Theme 

Whenever a student at Del Norte wants to take a specific class, they always ask around to see if they should take the class. They ask their upperclassmen if the class was too hard or if it was too easy and if it taught a lot or if it was unnecessary. In order to make that whole process easier, we created the Del Norte Class/Teacher ranking so that students can easily see the difficulty of each class and see some more comments about the class.

Billy 5/5 | This week was a big plan week. I worked with Raq on my assignment which was to [plan how every page will look and start on some html](https://github.com/Dubshott/spring_portfolio/projects/1#card-67461474). I also did some front end with Raq on the [about page.](https://github.com/Dubshott/spring_portfolio/blob/015abff6aec881deeb96c9fae3a32d28188b497c/src/main/resources/templates/about.html#L93-L118). We were able to get our own color scheme and are planning to add pictures of every teammate and a description of who they are. ALso I did the Unit 1 progress [Unit 1 Test Corrections](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8u2DtOz9iAvXIs7mHaztVnp4Cj2nw8abjSjG1y_Xfw/edit#bookmark=id.z7ta4z6jnczz)and [unit 2 test corrections](https://github.com/Dubshott/spring_portfolio/blob/9b7f6c18c92ada3c76f169615f718876ec4bf725/src/main/java/minilabs/billy/blab1.java#L1-L38). Also I worked on my [mini lab](https://github.com/Dubshott/spring_portfolio/blob/9b7f6c18c92ada3c76f169615f718876ec4bf725/src/main/java/minilabs/billy/blab1.java#L1-L38) this week. It focused on knowning how to use doubles and the more mathmatical side of unit 1. |
Kian  5/5|During this week, I’ve been reading up on creating databases using Spring in order to store the data. I’ve been creating some HTML pages and also mapping them and routing them in order for them to be used on the navigation bar. Here’s the website I’ve been using to study how to create and configure databases for our [data: ](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-mysql/). I’ve also been working on [W3schools](https://w3schools.com) to learn both Java and HTML better, since last year I was working on backend and didn’t really get to work with HTML much.   | 
Raquib 5/5|Throughout this week, I finally started on the [about us page](https://github.com/Dubshott/spring_portfolio/blob/9b7f6c18c92ada3c76f169615f718876ec4bf725/src/main/resources/templates/about.html#L56-L122) for our project. I looked up different videos on how to implement bootstrap into our project and furthermore, I also looked at various templates to see how bootstraps are done and how they are created. One website that has been helping me a lot to understand key concepts of code and help me understand what a bootstrap is and how it works is [W3schools](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiajLHJjuPyAhUJpp4KHTG_DAMQFnoECAMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3schools.com%2Fhowto%2Fhowto_css_about_page.asp&usg=AOvVaw3r0syvZMQoiyCdH9Ewr24i). On the about us page, our idea was to make sure the purpose of the project is shown and that our team and information about each one of us individuals are shown. So far, we have finished implementing a purpose of the project, and we also created a nice Navbar with a bit of animations implemented on them. In addition to working on the website, I also completed the [minilab](https://github.com/Dubshott/spring_portfolio/blob/9b7f6c18c92ada3c76f169615f718876ec4bf725/src/main/java/minilabs/raquib/rlab1.java#L1-L26) this week which focused on declaring variables and using different types of primitive variables to give a sample output of averages of those declared variables,.
|Abhijay 5/5|We all worked on the HTML pages and I set up the scrum board. I also looked up ways to include the API, but we weren’t able to find any. The solution for this is just to create our own list with the teacher’s names so that we can easily use them. We set that list in a database in order to work with that. Also looked up some CSS that we could use for our project. Animations will be a core part of our project, so we used w3schools to learn how to animate. We also finished the minilab using the basics of java that we learned from W3Schools. **Tanglibles:** [html page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1saDd8_4vsqSyr5p0YYfZhu60w-2SM03Si71GQyn9Inc/edit#bookmark=id.ygjirv6sdbfm) [W3schools CSS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1saDd8_4vsqSyr5p0YYfZhu60w-2SM03Si71GQyn9Inc/edit#bookmark=id.97ggmz3syf51) [MiniLab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1saDd8_4vsqSyr5p0YYfZhu60w-2SM03Si71GQyn9Inc/edit#bookmark=id.qvd0rtigvvka)|
