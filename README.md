# Del Norte Class/Teacher Rankings

# 1. Theme 

Whenever a student at Del Norte wants to take a specific class, they always ask around to see if they should take the class. They ask their upperclassmen if the class was too hard or if it was too easy and if it taught a lot or if it was unnecessary. In order to make that whole process easier, we created the Del Norte Class/Teacher ranking so that students can easily see the difficulty of each class and see some more comments about the class.
