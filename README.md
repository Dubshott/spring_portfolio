# Del Norte Class/Teacher Rankings

# Final Retrospective
* ###### What went well?
  - What went really well for me during this trimester is that I was able to fully learn Java and actually be able to participate in my group's project. I knew how to be helpful     and how to contribute with my group. Furthermore, we were organized, we did things on time, we helped each other out and we have great chemistry which really made this class     fun and not that bad for any of my group members and me! [Raquib Alam]
  - I think what went the best with our N@tM presentation was our beginning with Abhijay. Mr. M even complimented our start and said that we had the most engaging start in the       whole class. What also went well was our demo of our project, since we were able to navigate pretty smoothly through our website. [Kian K.]
  - My teamwork and collaboration skills definitely improved with my awesome team. In addition, I was able to learn some Java concepts and start incorporating it into something     that I do know, website development. I thought it was cool that we were able to implement that into our project and even create some labs with it. [Abhijay D.]
  - 

* ###### What didn't go that well?
  - What didn't go well is that at times we would get a little side tracked and some of the tangibles that we made didn't work to the best of their abilities  (or what we wanted     to see out of them). Such as the search bar feature on our website didn't work as it didn't fully look nice and when we searched something up, it didn't show anything or         give any suggestions. [Raquib Alam]
  - I think following the suggestions for the presentation and having features. I think we were short 1 feature, because we did have a search function, however it wasn't             functioning correctly by the time we had our presentation. Also, Mr. M suggested we show how to contribute to our project and to use the feedback from our peers to improve       our project, both of which we didn't show very clearly even though we had done them. [Kian K.]
  - Probably the PBL. I don't think we were able to make that much progress on it. This is partly due to being a senior because of senioritis. Also, we didn't really know how to     start using the Java concepts in our project, so we weren't sure where to go. We also spent a LOT more time on the labs compared to the PBL, which is another factor to it.       [Abhijay D.]
  - 

* ###### What did every team member learn?
  - What every team member learned is how to collaborate well and how they each did equal participation towards the group project. We were able to help each other out when we       needed it and we were able to collaborate really well and we instead became brothers and created a deeper connection. [Raquib Alam]
  - I think all of us learned a pretty decent amount of coding and how Java logic works. It's a lot more complicated than Python but we were able to gain a lot of understanding     by studying the Units from College Board. I, specifically, learned a lot of Javascript as well, since I learned how to code an entire database in Javascript using Google         Firebase. [Kian K.]
  - We definitely learned a lot of Java concepts through our labs and the Collegeboard videos and assignments. Billy even learned more about deployment and using the raspberry       pi. Raquib didn't have any experience with website development and now knows a lot more. Kian spent more time looking into Java backend and learning through those different     concepts with databases and such. I learned more about frontend and frontend related to Java like Thymeleaf and more CSS properties. [Abhijay D.]
  - 


* ###### What puzzles every team member?
  - What puzzles every team member is planning. that in my opinion, was the hardest part for our group as planning took a lot of time and thinking into what we wanted to see,       what we needed to see and what we didn't want to see. We had arguments on what should be on the project and what shouldn't and we had to make some tough decisions and this       is what made our team struggle as it was hard for us to agree and fully commit on something. [Raquib Alam]
  - I think for us it was mostly just how Java worked and the logic behind it. Previously, we learned about Python which was extremely straightforward and the only actually         difficult part of Python was learning the syntax. However with Java, the logic is much different and it took a while for us to just get a grip on how Java actually works.       [Kian K.]
  - Still how to set up a database using just Java. We set up something through the use of JavaScript and the Google's online database, but we were stumped when we tried to set     up an actual Java database. [Abhijay D.]

  - 

* ###### What was your favorite mini-lab project?
  - My favorite Mini lab project would probably be the ascii lab in which we turned a normal picture into grayscale and from the grayscale picture we assigned them ascii values     to create a final ascii image. This was really cool to see unfold and it was made possible with 2 d arrays and blocking sections of the image and turning them into specific     values [Raquib Alam]
  - My favorite mini-lab was the ASCII art lab. I thought it was really satisfying to see our lab actually function and correctly print the ASCII art of the inputted image. I       always though ASCII art was pretty cool so I also felt that this lab was pretty cool too. [Kian K.]
  - My favorite minilab was the minilab where we got into user input and showed a different result for each combination. If you look at the anime minilab, you can see the           different combinations we had for each character. We were able to use a lot more creativity for this lab and have a lot more fun with it compared to the other minilabs.         [Abhijay D.]
  - 

* ###### What was your favorite CB topic?
  - My favorite CB topic was about classes, and super classes and constructors which was unit 9. Overall, it was a fun topic to learn and it was like a combination of some           earlier topics into one, which made it really cool to se how all the units work together and how they are intertwined with one another. [Raquib Alam]
  - I think my favorite topic was the loops and Iterations. These two units were much easier to understand since they covered logic that exists in python too. The coding wasn't     that bad and the syntax is pretty simple [Kian K.]
  - My favorite CB topic was arrays and 2D-arrays because it was actually pretty interesting to learn about those different types of arrays and what applications can be used         with them. I also liked incorporating those with the Grayscale/ASCII art lab. [Abhijay D.]
  - 

* ###### Identify in priority order biggest challenges.
  - 1. Planning 2. Starting the code and coding the project [Raquib Alam]
  - 1. Database - I think the database was by far the most challenging aspect, I spent hours trying to get the database to take an input and display that output in a table. Even        though it was written in Javascript, it was still very confusing and frustrating until I figured it out
    2. Minilabs - Coding and figuring out how to code the minilabs was pretty difficult as well, since it required us to navigate through Java and figure out how Java works as a         whole
    3. Dividing up work - I think this was one of the difficulties for our team because although we did divide up the work, the people who were assigned backend usually needed           help from the other teammates, and this meant that a lot of people were working on backend while not too many were working on front end [Kian K.]
  - Database - Definitely the hardest thing because we had no clue how to use it.
    IntelliJ - I don't think my IntelliJ was working properly, but I had a lot of trouble with it through errors and other things like that even with troubleshooting. 
    [Abhijay D.]
  - 



* ###### What was your favorite N@tM project?
  - my favorite N@tM project is probably the del norte sports website where they had all the sports teams from our school and had updates and stuff on the players and team           record. It was really cool to see that! [Raquib Alam]
  - I think my favorite was the one with the Spotify embeds and movies. I thought it was really cool how all the top songs were listed as well as their embeds, allowing you to       listen to a clip of the song. I thought it was very unique and useful. [Kian K.]
  - My favorite project was the Senior Assassins one. I thought it was a really good idea since senior assassins is a big part of our school. I also liked how they incorporated     a minilab into the the project by using the grayscale lab to show which player was in and which player was out. The design of the website is also pretty good. I just really     liked the idea and I think it could be something pretty big, so I think this was my favorite one. [Abhijay D.]

# 1. Theme 

Whenever a student at Del Norte wants to take a specific class, they always ask around to see if they should take the class. They ask their upperclassmen if the class was too hard or if it was too easy and if it taught a lot or if it was unnecessary. In order to make that whole process easier, we created the Del Norte Class/Teacher ranking so that students can easily see the difficulty of each class and see some more comments about the class. People will be able to see all the different classes in a page and see a small rating chart. Then, they will be able to click the class and see the teachers that teach it and the overall rating of the class. You can even click the teacher and see the rating for them and the comments on them. 

We will be building this website through Spring and Thymeleaf. We will also be using HTML, CSS, and Java to make our website. Our main goal is building a database to store all the teacher and class information. Then, we will easily be able to bring in the data and use it for our code.

-------------    | --------------- |
Billy 5/5 | This week was a big plan week. I worked with Raq on my assignment which was to [plan how every page will look and start on some html](https://github.com/Dubshott/spring_portfolio/projects/1#card-67461474). I also did some front end with Raq on the [about page.](https://github.com/Dubshott/spring_portfolio/blob/015abff6aec881deeb96c9fae3a32d28188b497c/src/main/resources/templates/about.html#L93-L118). We were able to get our own color scheme and are planning to add pictures of every teammate and a description of who they are. ALso I did the Unit 1 progress [Unit 1 Test Corrections](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8u2DtOz9iAvXIs7mHaztVnp4Cj2nw8abjSjG1y_Xfw/edit#bookmark=id.z7ta4z6jnczz)and [unit 2 test corrections](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8u2DtOz9iAvXIs7mHaztVnp4Cj2nw8abjSjG1y_Xfw/edit#bookmark=id.med6ec1apsqi). Also I worked on my [mini lab](https://github.com/Dubshott/spring_portfolio/blob/9b7f6c18c92ada3c76f169615f718876ec4bf725/src/main/java/minilabs/billy/blab1.java#L1-L38) this week. It focused on knowning how to use doubles and the more mathmatical side of unit 1. |
Kian  5/5|During this week, I’ve been reading up on creating databases using Spring in order to store the data. I’ve been creating some HTML pages and also mapping them and routing them in order for them to be used on the navigation bar. Here’s the website I’ve been using to study how to create and configure databases for our [data: ](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-mysql/). I’ve also been working on [W3schools](https://w3schools.com) to learn both Java and HTML better, since last year I was working on backend and didn’t really get to work with HTML much.   | 
Raquib 5/5|Throughout this week, I finally started on the [about us page](https://github.com/Dubshott/spring_portfolio/blob/9b7f6c18c92ada3c76f169615f718876ec4bf725/src/main/resources/templates/about.html#L56-L122) for our project. I looked up different videos on how to implement bootstrap into our project and furthermore, I also looked at various templates to see how bootstraps are done and how they are created. One website that has been helping me a lot to understand key concepts of code and help me understand what a bootstrap is and how it works is [W3schools](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiajLHJjuPyAhUJpp4KHTG_DAMQFnoECAMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3schools.com%2Fhowto%2Fhowto_css_about_page.asp&usg=AOvVaw3r0syvZMQoiyCdH9Ewr24i). On the about us page, our idea was to make sure the purpose of the project is shown and that our team and information about each one of us individuals are shown. So far, we have finished implementing a purpose of the project, and we also created a nice Navbar with a bit of animations implemented on them. In addition to working on the website, I also completed the [minilab](https://github.com/Dubshott/spring_portfolio/blob/9b7f6c18c92ada3c76f169615f718876ec4bf725/src/main/java/minilabs/raquib/rlab1.java#L1-L26) this week which focused on declaring variables and using different types of primitive variables to give a sample output of averages of those declared variables,. [Unit 1 Test corrections](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8u2DtOz9iAvXIs7mHaztVnp4Cj2nw8abjSjG1y_Xfw/edit#bookmark=id.c2bba7ha15n6)and [Unit 2 test corrections](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8u2DtOz9iAvXIs7mHaztVnp4Cj2nw8abjSjG1y_Xfw/edit#bookmark=id.med6ec1apsqi)
|Abhijay 5/5|We all worked on the HTML pages and I set up the scrum board. I also looked up ways to include the API, but we weren’t able to find any. The solution for this is just to create our own list with the teacher’s names so that we can easily use them. We set that list in a database in order to work with that. Also looked up some CSS that we could use for our project. Animations will be a core part of our project, so we used w3schools to learn how to animate. We also finished the minilab using the basics of java that we learned from W3Schools. **Tanglibles:** [html page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1saDd8_4vsqSyr5p0YYfZhu60w-2SM03Si71GQyn9Inc/edit#bookmark=id.ygjirv6sdbfm) [W3schools CSS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1saDd8_4vsqSyr5p0YYfZhu60w-2SM03Si71GQyn9Inc/edit#bookmark=id.97ggmz3syf51) [MiniLab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1saDd8_4vsqSyr5p0YYfZhu60w-2SM03Si71GQyn9Inc/edit#bookmark=id.qvd0rtigvvka)|

# Team/Individual Plans:
- Each pair (Billy/Raq and Abhijay/Kian) will switch off between front end and back end every week. This is ideal. Of course there will be weeks where both pairs overlap. Everyone is given assignments on the [scrum board](https://github.com/Dubshott/spring_portfolio/projects/1) every week and the goal is to finish these assignments.
